## About The Project

Group selection is an evolutionary mechanism in which natural selection takes place in groups instead than at individual level. One of the main difficulties when trying to model these type of systems, is the fact that selfish individuals can try to take advantage of the group they are in by not giving any contribution to the group and making use at the same of the resources available (making them grow at a faster rate compared to cooperative individuals). This same concept of how having a cooperative or selfish behaviour can favour (or not) an individual, is studied in Behavioural Game Theory [1]. Additionally, it is at times argued that natural selection through evolution based on fitness ("survival of the fittest") incentivize individuals to be selfish in order to outpace the competition [2].

In "Individual Selection for Cooperative Group Formation" by Simon T. Powers et al [3], is examined how individuals cooperative/selfish behaviour in small and large groups can make the different groups evolve over time.

In this repository, Simon T. Powers' work will be first reproduced and then expanded.

## Getting Started

If you want to test this project on your local machine, please use the following instructions.

### Installation

This repository can be downloaded in your desired directory by just using the following command in the Command Window (CMD).
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pierpaolo28/Reproduced-Research-Papers.git
```

### Prerequisites

Once downloaded the repository, all the necessary dependencies can be installed using the following command.

```sh
cd "Reproduced-Research-Papers/Genetic Algorithms"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This requirements.txt file was created using the Python [pipreqs](https://www.idiotinside.com/2015/05/10/python-auto-generate-requirements-txt/) package.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Detailed explanations about this project and the background research motivations is available in the Evolution_of_Complexity report PDF and in the Simon T.
